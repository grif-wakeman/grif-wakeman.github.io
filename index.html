        <h3><span class="green">Month 1:</span><span>&ensp;</span> BRIEF & STRATEGY</h3>
        <p>You‚Äôll dive right into the Sync Beast strategy, principles, and process. Then I‚Äôll guide you on choosing a
            brief to work from for your 3-track sync project. Once you‚Äôre locked-in and feel confident with a brief you
            can absolutely crush, it‚Äôs time to start sketching out your ideas. </p>
        <p>You‚Äôll create 6 different sketches that come directly from the brief and the strategy we hand you. I‚Äôll
            approve the highest-value 3 sketches as the foundation of your sync project, and we‚Äôll focus all of our
            efforts on making them into full-fledged tracks.</p>
        <h3 class="month-title"><span class="green">Month 2-4:</span><span>&ensp;</span> BUILD & COLLAB</h3>
        <p>I‚Äôll take you through my direct feedback process ‚Äì As much as it takes to get the tracks up to Sync Beast
            standard. My team and I will make sure your tracks have exactly what they need to check all the boxes that
            big brands look for.</p>
        <p>By month 3-4, you‚Äôll have built 3 instrumental tracks that are ready for collabs, whether that‚Äôs a topliner,
            session player, or co-producer. We‚Äôll continue the feedback process until the final versions are approved.
        </p>
        <h3 class="month-title"><span class="green">Month 5-6:</span><span>&ensp;</span> FINALIZE & PITCH</h3>
        <p>This is where we‚Äôll wrap the music portion of your 3-track project. We‚Äôll get any last revisions from
            collaborators and implement any final feedback notes. Once all tracks are approved and ready for wrap up,
            we‚Äôll move into making shorter versions to increase your chances of getting a sync.</p>
        <p>You‚Äôll design a hyper-authentic brand for your project. We wrap all Sync Beast projects in branding that
            feels good on the eyes and matches the quality of the music. Your project will look, feel, and sound like it
            should be on Spotify, which positions you for the best pitch.</p>
        <p>Then, we‚Äôll land your project in one of the biggest libraries in the world. This is where your project will
            start getting pitched to the biggest brands within days.</p>

        <p>I didn‚Äôt know that sync could change my entire f*cking life until the day I cashed my first sync check.</p>
        <p>I felt the power and didn‚Äôt want it to end at the bank.</p>
        <p>Getting more placements was the only thing I could think about, but had no idea where to start.</p>
        <p>I studied thousands of ads and the music in them.</p>
        <p>I listened to countless tracks in my library‚Äôs catalog.</p>
        <p>I spent years with a mentor who guided me in making custom music for brands as the staff composer at Marmoset
            Music.</p>
        <p>And it wasn‚Äôt until I applied it all to my sync tracks that it became clear:</p>
        <h2>This industry has rules, and the ones who play by them win.</h2>
        <p>So I designed my own sync strategy to speed up the time it took for my tracks to earn for me.</p>
        <p>Repeatable moves + faster syncs = stable income.</p>
        <p>Nothing made me happier than turning my sync production process into a game‚Ä¶</p>
        <p>Except for the money, of course.</p>
        <p>1500+ licensable assets, $2 million in sync revenue, and 8 long years of grinding showed me what‚Äôs possible
            with the right strategy.</p>
        <p>And that‚Äôs what I offer you today:</p>
        <p>The clearest path to actually make serious money with your music without the wait.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Yes, even if you don‚Äôt have a big catalog.</span></p>
        <p><span class="bold">Yes, even if you don‚Äôt have years in the game.</span></p>
        <p><span class="bold">And yes, even if your sync checks are hella small right now.</span></p>
        <p>You deserve to finally see a return. I‚Äôll get you there.</p>

        <p>Before I joined the SBA, I felt like I was running into walls and was really burnt out. I kept getting told
            my music was good, but not sync‚Äôable. I also felt like my collaborators weren‚Äôt the people I wanted to work
            with, but instead were just ‚Äúavailable‚Äù. Now, I feel like I'm making great music with a purpose and
            collab‚Äôing with amazing people that are on the same path. I'm focused on creating high-value tracks, rather
            than chasing the sync placement. I'm greatly appreciative of Graham‚Äôs mentorship, which gives me loads of
            confidence when creating and networking.</p>

        </div>
        <p>I felt overwhelmed, exhausted, and alone. I was getting syncs and custom jobs, but I always felt like I
            started blind. Without a real strategy, it took so long to figure things out. Plus, I ran after every shiny
            job that wasn‚Äôt best-suited for my skillset. Since joining the SBA, I‚Äôm armored with a much better strategy.
            And most importantly, I feel less lonely with the community and calls. They give me so much energy and
            clarity by hearing that others are going through the same things I am. And the fact that I now know how to
            properly attack a brief without feeling overwhelmed and confused is worth so, so much. It's taken away a big
            stress in that sense for me. Plus, Graham‚Äôs awesome feedback and pep talks are a lifesaver.</p>

        <p>Getting to join the SBA is like seeing behind the curtain. Or at the end of the Matrix where Neo sees the
            code of the world around him. There are all these guys selling courses and memberships about sync and
            library music, and it‚Äôs all the same stuff: Write an album of whatever cues. Cold email a bunch of
            libraries. Repeat. Maybe pay a month of rent 4 years from now, while all those guys market six-figure checks
            and achievements. They build courses based on past (maybe even ancient) successes. Graham teaches producers
            and composers how to be successful in sync in the highest leverage way: Writing fewer, higher quality tracks
            that sync more and pay bigger. Graham practices what he preaches and has successful students that kill it
            every day, sharing their wins and exactly how they do it in the group. I had an idea of how to succeed in
            sync, but nothing concrete. And now I have a definite step-by-step game plan to massively succeed in sync
            over the next five years.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Before I joined SBA, I had some success in sync, but wanted to take it to the next level. I wanted a
            sustainable strategy for sync. I lacked a plan for consistency and didn‚Äôt have a sure target of where I
            wanted my music to hit and be the most profitable. Now, I have the roadmap to the destination I was
            searching for. I feel more confident about the music I make. I truly believe what we‚Äôre doing in the SBA
            will make me a more profitable producer. Having like-minded creatives to learn with / from is amazing. I
            learn better in community-centric environments like this, more so than just a ‚Äúcourse‚Äù.</p>

        <p>Before I joined, I felt lonely, like I didn‚Äôt have a go-to person that I felt comfortable asking for help and
            guidance. Now that I‚Äôve been in for a few months, I feel grateful to have a cool community to grow with, I
            feel less alone. And I feel fully equipped to handle any curveball because I can count on Graham‚Äôs seasoned
            support and feedback to offer guidance or even bounce ideas off of. I can make bolder growth steps without
            feeling so scared because I know that I have a reliable, structured support system. The difference between
            ‚Äúpre‚Äù SBA and ‚Äúin‚Äù SBA feels monumental for me.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôd absolutely recommend the SBA to anyone who‚Äôs dead serious about sync, and has some sync education under
            their belt. This is for advanced sync producers. This is not a Sync 101 course. Before I joined, things
            moved rather slowly ‚Äì One placement to my name. I took two "Sync 101" courses (basic sync vocab terms, some
            feedback calls, no science, no psychology, etc). I was kind of wandering, picking up gems here and there
            from ‚Äúsync-fluencers‚Äù, unsure how to consistently approach my music in the sync industry and its actual
            needs. The SBA community is open and available to answer questions, give feedback, and collaborate. Now I
            have a better understanding of the sync game with a new mindset, creating music for sync. I‚Äôm learning that
            focus, strategizing, visualizing, and execution are some of my best friends in this industry.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôve had so many pieces of the puzzle fill in for me. The strategy and processes that Graham teaches are
            incredibly powerful when you put them to use! Before I joined I felt alone. I wasn‚Äôt around many other sync
            producers and was unclear of how to approach making music for sync ‚Äì Shooting in the dark, so to speak. The
            SBA has given me a community of like-minded people, as well as a clear strategy on how to approach building
            projects for sync. Having been a touring musician and indie producer for hire, it‚Äôs been a long process of
            shifting my mindset from that of a worker, to owner and entrepreneur. Graham and the talented folks in the
            SBA have helped me to believe that I can build a catalog of assets that will keep paying me and working for
            me far into the future. Graham teaches us, not only the technical side of sync production, but the mindset
            and attitudes needed to succeed in this career. This program is worth 10x what I paid for it.</p>
